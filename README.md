# graph-algo
To learn graph algorithm from the book "Programming Game AI by Example", wrote by Mat Buckland, I created this project.  
Just for self-learning. Some graph algorithm implemented in Go.  
For now, it includes deep-first-search, branch-first-search, bidirectional search on BFS.  
Deep-first-search uses a stack as its core data architecture.  
Branch-first-search uses a queue as its core data architecture.  
a.map is the origin map data.
